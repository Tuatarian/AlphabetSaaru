The internal representation of a [[Node]]'s [[Operations | Operation]]. Each Nodetype will be an index in a Table, which will be a function to perform an operation on the inputs and yield an output. Probably possible to just make a `Table[string, (seq[string]) -> string]`. Another possibility is to have a function that performs all operations with a massive case statement for all NodeTypes, but since this is much messier this is a fallback option.
