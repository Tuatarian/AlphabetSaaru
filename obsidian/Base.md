Start with 0 (<sub>2</sub>), manipulate through various number systems to produce some text result

0..25 -> 'a'..'z''
0..11001

~~represent number system with [[Subscript {OBSOLETE}]] (ie 12<sub>10</sub>, 1011<sub>2</sub>). Primarily likely to be in binary, perhaps have some decimal ops, perhaps include hex~~

Only binary will be used for gameplay. As a result, when displaying the numbers in a [[Node]] with a [[NodeType]], the format `number in binary (number in decimal)` will be used. Decimal is shown to make the game more friendly to those less intimately familiar with binary who have to convert manually every time (such as myself)

[[Operations]] can be done on numbers (ideas in [[List of Operations]], represented as a block in space linked to input(s) and outut(s), each having a [[Cost]]

Will create some sort of a [[Graph]] structure for the game
